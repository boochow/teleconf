## About

Teleconf is a modulation FX unit for Korg logue SDK compatible synthesizers.

It modulates the input sounds as if it comes from a teleconference device.

Technically this module applies a bandpass filter and [G.711 a-law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.711) codec to input sounds.

## Parameters

1. Time changes the filters' resonance value.

1. Depth adds the wet signal to the output signal.
